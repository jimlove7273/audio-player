# Audio Player with Play List

### information

This is a relatively simple MP3 audio player using HTML's &lt;audio&gt; tag. When launched, it has a main player and you can play or pause songs. If you use a play list feature by using a array list of songs, you would see the play list below the player. The play list shows a list of songs with the current song highlighted and a check mark next to it to indicate the songs that's currently playing. The player also has a volume control so you can control the volume when playing an audio.

## Files

There are three files to this music player
**index.html** - this is the main HTML file that renders the player and play list. You can pretty much leave it the way it is, but if you changed a class or ID name, you need to update its CSS file.
**style.css** - The CSS file that styles the player. I have put all the colors you need for the player on top of the file where it defines the variables. Modifying these values will change the look and feel of the audio player so be careful changing them.
**script.js** - The JavaScript that makes it possible. This contains all the special functions and event listeners that trigger the song playing or stopping (pausing), lets you change the song to play, and change the player volume.

### Enhancements

I will continue making changes to the files to make it run or work better. Some of the future enhancements I will implement include:

1. When a song ends, it will automatically grab the next song from the list to play.
2. Adding album images when the songs play.
3. and more ....
